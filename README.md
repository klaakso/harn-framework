# harn-framework
HapiJS, ArangoDB, ReactJS, and NodeJS boilerplate for rapid prototypes and getting you to MVP state... enterprise ready

## Why?
Javascript is good for quick prototyping and sprinting to an MVP state for your project / product. This project came about from its use in quickly building enterprise-level application POCs.

Because ArangoDB is a promising multi-model database which allows graph representation. HapiJS is an enterprise-ready framework which is battle-tested and well-rounded for scaleability. ReactJS allows sever-side rendering in HapiJS for a mix of server-and-client side rendering.

The purpose of this stack is to be non-intrusive to your long-term scaleability. You can use this for web or mobile micro-services, or kick it 2003 and build a monolithic NodeJS app.

## Stack Dependencies
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - "Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient."

[HapiJS](http://hapijs.com/) - "Hapi enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure."

[ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) - "A distributed free and open-source database with a flexible data model for documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions."

[ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) - "React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native."
